# Python Hangman Game

A simple Hangman game built in Python where the player guesses a randomly selected word based on its difficulty level: easy, medium, or hard. The game provides the option to use hints (up to 3 times) and tracks the player's and computer's scores.

## Features

- Three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.
- Word suggestions are read from external text files for each difficulty.
- A maximum of 3 hints can be used during the game.
- Interactive user interface with colorful console outputs.
- Tracks and displays scores for both the player and the computer.
- ASCII-based hangman graphic displayed with each incorrect guess.

## How to Play

1. **Start the game** by running the Python script.
2. **Select a difficulty level** from the options:
    - **Easy (a)**
    - **Medium (b)**
    - **Hard (c)**
3. **Guess a letter** of the word.
4. If you need a hint, you can type `hint`, but you have a limited number of hints.
5. **Continue guessing** until you guess the entire word or the hangman reaches its maximum number of tries (6).
6. **Keep track of your score** and play again if you wish!
